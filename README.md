# Habitech

  Originally part of an assignment for a previous Swift class I took, this todo app will become a more intuitive tool for a user to log goals for good habits. 
As someone who struggles with establishing good habits, I figured I inspire myself with developing good habits as well as create an app that will potentially help others too.
My current objectives for this app is to create a home page where the user can log in their personal goals using SMART, and then a schedule will be produced to help keep track of 
the goals over a period of time. Then for each day the user can enter daily tasks that remind them to perform their good habits. Over time the app will encourage and reward the user
for keeping up the progress.
